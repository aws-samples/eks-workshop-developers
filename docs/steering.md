## Tenets
* **Kubernetes Beginner-Friendly**: Our goal is to employ Kubernetes and container tools that are straightforward and easy to grasp, while demystifying fundamental Kubernetes concepts for newcomers embarking on their Kubernetes journey.
* **Comprehensive Transparency**: We strive to reveal the inner workings, from the application level to containers and Kubernetes, enabling developers to understand and fully adopt our practices.
* **Customer-Centric Focus**: We are committed to actively utilizing insights from the [feedback survey](https://pulse.aws/survey/IQNXSTCC) to guide and refine our workshop's future development, ensuring it continually meets and exceeds user needs.

## Chapters

* [**Introduction (a.k.a., Refactoring)**](https://github.com/aws-samples/eks-workshop-developers/tree/main/website/docs/introduction). This programming language-heavy chapter provides EKS developers with essential guidance to refactor their applications for containers and Kubernetes, including application programming and development using [the twelve-factor app](https://12factor.net/) principles.
* [**Containers**](https://github.com/aws-samples/eks-workshop-developers/tree/main/website/docs/containers). This containers-focused chapter guides EKS developers through the steps to optimize and deploy their Python applications in a container environment, including constructing multi-service builder/runner container images, multi-architecture images compatible with EKS, and using Amazon ECR. 
* [**Kubernetes**](https://github.com/aws-samples/eks-workshop-developers/tree/main/website/docs/kubernetes). This beginner-friendly Kubernetes-focused chapter guides EKS developers through the different Kubernetes objects for their stateless and stateful application workloads, how to deploy the workloads to a local minikube cluster, and access the app outside the cluster. 
* [**EKS (a.k.a., EKS & AWS)**](https://github.com/aws-samples/eks-workshop-developers/tree/main/website/docs/eks). This EKS and AWS-focused chapter guides developers through the steps to deploy their stateless and stateful workloads to Amazon EKS, and all the controllers, drivers, and services required to run those workloads. It includes integrations with AWS services.

## Responsibilities

* **Steering Committee**. The steering committee is responsible for driving project-wide changes, i.e. changes that can potentially affect all of the working groups, such as upgrading to a new Kubernetes version, etc.
* **Working Groups**. Working groups are be responsible for creating and maintaining the workshop chapter(s). Chairs serve as project managers for the workshop chapters in their topic area and maintaining quality of their chapter(s), determined via the **[workshop survey](https://pulse.aws/survey/IQNXSTCC)**. 

### Chairs

Chairs are the strategic leaders and visionaries of our workshop chapters. Their role involves inspiring innovation, fostering excellence, and driving the continuous evolution of the workshop. As stewards of your respective areas, you hold a pivotal position in shaping the educational journey of workshop participants.

* **Feedback Utilization Criteria**:
    * **Threshold for Action**: Establish chapter and page benchmarks, such as if a page within a chapter receives less than an 80% affirmative response to "Did you learn something new from this lab exercise?" over six months, it triggers a review process.
    * **Quantitative Assessmen**t: Utilize the numerical ratings from "How helpful was this lab exercise?" as a supplementary measure for information relevance. Consider setting a minimum average score (e.g., 3.5 out of 5) for a specified period as another trigger for review.
* **Qualitative Feedback Integration**:
    * **Comments Analysis**: Regularly review responses to "How would you improve this lab exercise?" to identify common themes or suggestions.
    * **Ongoing Improvement**: Share these comments in monthly committee meetings and within your working group to drive iterative improvements, even when quantitative thresholds are not met.
* **Responsibility Assignment**:
    * **Role of the Chair**: Responsible for monitoring metrics, initiating discussions and driving improvements within the working group. This ensures accountability and keeps the focus on quality and relevance.
    * **Collaboration and Approval**: While the chair initiates changes, they should collaborate with maintainers and the broader community for diverse insights. Significant changes should be presented to the steering committee for approval.
    * **Major Changes**: Use [FEATURES](https://github.com/aws-samples/python-fastapi-demo-docker/blob/main/FEATURES.md) to communicate major app enhancements to the broader community. Major app enhancements should be paired with a corresponding lab exercise.
* **Process for Redesign**:
    * **Initiating Redesign**: If a lab exercise falls below the set thresholds, the chair convenes the working group to analyze feedback and propose redesigns.
    * **Community Involvement**: Consider involving the community members who provided feedback in the friction logging process, either through targeted outreach or open calls for contributions or feedback.
* **Regular Reporting**:
    * **Feedback Reports**: The chair should compile and present regular reports on survey feedback, both quantitative and qualitative, to the steering committee.
    * **Transparency**: Share summarized feedback and improvement plans with the community to maintain transparency and encourage continued participation in the feedback process.

### Maintainers

Maintainers play a pivotal role in the vitality and progress of our workshop chapters. They are the craftsmen and custodians of chapter quality, ensuring that each contribution aligns with our standards and goals.

* **Pull Request Management**:
    * **Prompt Response**: Maintainers commit to acknowledging new pull requests within 48 hours, ensuring timely engagement with contributors.
    * **Timely Reviews**: Strive to complete reviews within one week, balancing thoroughness with efficiency.
    * **Constructive Feedback**: Provide detailed, actionable feedback to foster a supportive and collaborative development environment.
* **Consistent Contributions**:
    * **Active Participation**: Maintain a steady rhythm of contributions, aiming for a set number of reviews or updates per month to ensure continuous improvements.
    * **Contribution Visibility**: Your efforts are visible and valued. Regular acknowledgments of contributions reinforce our culture of recognition and appreciation.
* **Skill Advancement**:
    * **Development Opportunities**: Engage in ongoing learning opportunities to stay at the forefront of our field and share findings during committee meetings.
    * **Sharing Expertise**: Regularly participate in knowledge exchange sessions, sharing insights and learning from peers.
* **User-Centric Development**:
    * **Integrating User Feedback**: Actively incorporate user feedback into chapter improvements, ensuring that our content remains relevant and effective.
    * **Collaborative Improvement**: Work in harmony with chairs and the broader community to imbue chapters with diverse perspectives and expertise.
