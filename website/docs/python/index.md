# Welcome to the EKS Developers Workshop for Python
Welcome to the EKS Developers Workshop, a technical deep-dive into refactoring applications for Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). 

## Who Is This Workshop For?
This workshop is tailored for developers that want to refactor an application for containers and Kubernetes environments using EKS. It's specifically designed to be Kubernetes beginner-friendly and particularly beneficial for those who: 

* Need visibility of the entire Kubernetes lifecycle, from refactoring containers, to Kubernetes integrations on Amazon EKS.
* Have a foundational understanding of container technologies and seek to increase their knowledge of Kubernetes-based application deployments.
* Aim to transition traditional applications to cloud-native architectures, particularly within the AWS ecosystem.

## What You Will Learn
* **Application Refactoring:** Learn how to apply The Twelve-Factor App methodologies to refactor applications for containers and Kubernetes.

* **Containerization Techniques:** Master the creation and management of Docker containers, integrate Amazon ECR with Docker Compose, and handle multi-architecture containers.
* **Kubernetes Deployment:** Learn how to deploy your application to a local minikube cluster, including securing workloads with Kubernetes secrets.
* **Amazon EKS Deployment:** Build your skills deploying Kubernetes workloads in production on Amazon EKS, integrating with AWS services like AWS Secrets Manager and Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL. 

## How to Participate in the Workshop
This workshop offers a self-paced, comprehensive guide through the entire Kubernetes lifecycle. From creating multi-architecture container images, to understanding Kubernetes, to integrating with Amazon EKS and other AWS services, this workshop is a continuous, end-to-end exploration. Each chapter is designed to build upon the previous, ensuring a cohesive learning experience. 

To get started with the workshop:

* **In Your Own Account**: This option allows for a personalized and hands-on experience, using your AWS account to create resources.
* **At an AWS Event**: Engage in a more guided and structured learning environment at an AWS Event using AWS Workshop Studio platform, ideal for those who prefer collaborative learning sessions.

This workshop has an approximate duration of 4 hours.
