## Objective

This lab shows you how to create a multi-architecture container image for the FastAPI application using [docker buildx](https://github.com/docker/buildx), which is Docker CLI plugin for extended build capabilities with BuildKit. The PostgreSQL database, utilizing the official "postgres:13" image, is sourced directly from Docker Hub, eliminating the necessity to construct and deploy a custom image for it.

## Prerequisites

- [Integrating Amazon ECR with Docker Compose](integration-ecr.md)

<!--This is a shared file at src/includes/get-env-vars.md that tells users to navigate to the 'python-fastapi-demo-docker' directory where their environment variables are sourced.-->
<GetEnvVars />

## 1. Logging into Amazon ECR

From the 'python-fastapi-demo-docker' project directory, authenticate the Docker CLI to your Amazon ECR registry using:

```bash
aws ecr get-login-password \
--region ${AWS_REGION} | docker login \
--username AWS \
--password-stdin ${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}.dkr.ecr.${AWS_REGION}.amazonaws.com
```

You should see the following response output: “Login Succeeded”.

Alternatively, if you're using Finch, run the following command to authenticate to your Amazon ECR registry:

```bash
aws ecr get-login-password \
--region ${AWS_REGION} | finch login \
--username AWS \
--password-stdin ${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}.dkr.ecr.${AWS_REGION}.amazonaws.com
```

## 2. Building Multi-Architecture Docker Image for the Web Service

You can use `docker buildx` to build Docker images for application and database services that are compatible with multiple architectures, including Kubernetes clusters.

First, create and start new builder instances for the web service:

```bash
docker buildx create --name webBuilder
docker buildx use webBuilder
docker buildx inspect --bootstrap
```

The expected output should look like this:

```bash
webBuilder
[+] Building 2.7s (1/1) FINISHED
 => [internal] booting buildkit                                                                                            2.6s

Name:   webBuilder
Driver: docker-container

Nodes:
Name:      webbuilder0
Endpoint:  unix:///var/run/docker.sock
Status:    running
Platforms: linux/amd64, linux/amd64/v2, linux/amd64/v3, linux/arm64, linux/riscv64, linux/ppc64le, linux/s390x, linux/386, linux/mips64le, linux/mips64, linux/arm/v7, linux/arm/v6
```

Alternatively, if you're using Finch, run the following command to build the multi-architecture image:

```bash
finch build \
    --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
    --tag ${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}.dkr.ecr.${AWS_REGION}.amazonaws.com/fastapi-microservices:${IMAGE_VERSION} \
    .
```

## 3. Pushing the Image to Amazon ECR

Next, build and push the images for your web service by running the following commands:

```bash
docker buildx use webBuilder
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t ${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}.dkr.ecr.${AWS_REGION}.amazonaws.com/fastapi-microservices:${IMAGE_VERSION} . --push
```

Alternatively, if you're using Finch, upload the images to ECR using the following command:

```bash
finch push \
    --all-platforms \
    ${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}.dkr.ecr.${AWS_REGION}.amazonaws.com/fastapi-microservices:${IMAGE_VERSION}
```

This builds Docker images based on the Dockerfile instructions and pushes them to your ECR repository.
The expected output should look like this :

```bash

```

## 4. Running the Services as Docker Containers

After building the images, start the application and database services in separate Docker containers using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Alternatively, if you're using Finch, run the following command:

```bash
finch compose up
```

This command initiates containers for each service as specified in the docker-compose.yml file. You can connect to the service and access FastAPI application from your browser similarly to Step #2 in section [Building and Running the Docker Containers](./build-image.md#2-running-the-services-as-docker-containers).


## 5. Stopping the Services and Their Containers

Stop and remove the containers of both services by pressing `CTRL + C` or running the following command:

```bash
docker-compose down --volumes
```

Alternatively, if you're using Finch, run the following command:

```bash
finch compose down
```

## 6. Rebuilding and Restarting Docker Services

If you make changes to your application, you can rebuild the multi-architecture images using the following commands:

Define a new image version
```
IMAGE_VERSION=1.2
```

Rebuild the image and push it to your ECR repository:
```bash
docker buildx use webBuilder
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t ${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}.dkr.ecr.${AWS_REGION}.amazonaws.com/fastapi-microservices:${IMAGE_VERSION} . --push
```

Alternatively, if you're using Finch, you can run:

```bash
finch build \
    --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
    --tag ${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}.dkr.ecr.${AWS_REGION}.amazonaws.com/fastapi-microservices:${IMAGE_VERSION} \
    .

finch push \
    --all-platforms \
    ${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}.dkr.ecr.${AWS_REGION}.amazonaws.com/fastapi-microservices:${IMAGE_VERSION}
```

This command rebuilds the Docker image and pushes it to your ECR repository.

## Cleanup

Run the following command to clean up created images:

```bash
docker rmi -f $(docker images "${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}.dkr.ecr.${AWS_REGION}.amazonaws.com/*" -q)
```

Alternatively, if you're using Finch, run the following command to clean-up created images, including dangling images:

```bash
finch rmi -f $(finch images --filter reference=${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}.dkr.ecr.${AWS_REGION}.amazonaws.com -q)
finch rmi $(finch images -f "dangling=true" -q)      
```

## Conclusion

This lab explored the process of constructing and executing Docker containers using Docker Compose in the `python-fastapi-demo-docker` project. We also demonstrated how to use Docker's buildx feature to create Docker images that are compatible with multiple CPU architectures. This approach provides an efficient way to manage multi-service applications, enhancing their portability and ensuring they can run on a wider range of platforms.
