import GetEnvVars from '../../../src/includes/get-env-vars.md';

## Objective
This lab shows how to update the resource requests and limits data based on our load testing to ensure that our applications have enough resources to handle high load, while also optimizing the overall resource usage in our cluster.
## Prerequisites
- [Right-Sizing Your Pods with Minikube and Metrics Server](./pods-sizing.md)

<!--This is a shared file at src/includes/get-env-vars.md that tells users to navigate to the 'python-fastapi-demo-docker' directory where their environment variables are sourced.-->
<GetEnvVars />

## 1. Updating fastapi-app.yaml for Enhanced Resource Management
The [fastapi-app.yaml](https://github.com/aws-samples/python-fastapi-demo-docker/blob/main/kubernetes/fastapi-app.yaml) manifest contains the resources for our FastAPI application. We're going to adjust the resource requests and limits for this deployment based on the data we've gathered.

From the 'python-fastapi-demo-docker' project directory, open the **[fastapi-app.yaml](https://github.com/aws-samples/python-fastapi-demo-docker/blob/main/kubernetes/fastapi-app.yaml)** in a text editor and find the section that defines the resources for the **web** container:
```bash
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: "100m"
            memory: "100Mi"
          limits:
            cpu: "500m"
            memory: "500Mi"
```

Based on our load testing results, increase the limits to allow the application to utilize more resources under high load:
```bash
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: "200m"
            memory: "200Mi"
          limits:
            cpu: "1000m"
            memory: "1000Mi"
```

## 2. Updating postgres-db.yaml for Efficient Resource Utilization
The [postgres-db.yaml](https://github.com/aws-samples/python-fastapi-demo-docker/blob/main/kubernetes/postgres-db.yaml) manifest contains the resources for our PostgreSQL database. We'll adjust the resource requests and limits for this deployment as well. 

From the 'python-fastapi-demo-docker' project directory, open the **[postgres-db.yaml](https://github.com/aws-samples/python-fastapi-demo-docker/blob/main/kubernetes/postgres-db.yaml)** file in a text editor and find the section that defines the resources for the **db** container:
```bash
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: "100m"
            memory: "100Mi"
          limits:
            cpu: "500m"
            memory: "500Mi"
```

Based on load testing, the PostgreSQL pod was not using much of its allocated resources, decrease the limits to free up resources for other pods:
```bash
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: "50m"
            memory: "50Mi"
          limits:
            cpu: "250m"
            memory: "250Mi"
```

## 3. Applying the Configurations
Once you've updated your manifests, apply the changes using the following commands:
```bash
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/fastapi-app.yaml
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/postgres-db.yaml
```

## 4. Retrieving the Pod Names
Now let's confirm that the changes have been correctly applied by using the 'describe pod' command. This command provides a detailed view of the configuration for a specific pod, including its resource allocation. 

Since new pod names were generated based on our changes, let's retrieve the names of all pods in the namespace:
```bash
kubectl get pods -n my-cool-app
```

The expected output should look like this:
```bash
NAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
fastapi-deployment-86574858b9-n2c8t   1/1     Running   0          2m32s
fastapi-postgres-0                    1/1     Running   0          2m15s
```

## 5. Verifying FastAPI App Resource Allocation
Next, check the 'fastapi-deployment' pod, which hosts our FastAPI application:

```bash
kubectl describe pod fastapi-deployment-86574858b9-n2c8t -n my-cool-app
```

Look for the 'Resources' section under 'Containers' in the output. This section will display the CPU and memory requests and limits that we just set for the pod:
```bash

## 6. Verifying PostgreSQL Resource Allocation
Finally, check the pod that hosts our PostgreSQL application:
```bash
kubectl describe pod fastapi-postgres-0 -n my-cool-app
```
You should see something like this:
```bash

```

## Cleanup

**Optionally**, if you want to stop the workshop at this point, run the following command to clean up the Kubernetes resources created by minikube.

```bash
 minikube delete --all --purge
```

You should see something like this:

```bash
ðŸ”¥  Deleting "minikube" in docker ...
ðŸ”¥  Removing /Users/dbattula/.minikube/machines/minikube ...
ðŸ’€  Removed all traces of the "minikube" cluster.
ðŸ”¥  Successfully deleted all profiles
ðŸ’€  Successfully purged minikube directory located at - [/Users/dbattula/.minikube]
ðŸ“Œ  Kicbase images have not been deleted. To delete images run:
    â–ª docker rmi gcr.io/k8s-minikube/kicbase:v0.0.40
```

## Conclusion
This lab showed how to update the Kubernetes manifests for the FastAPI and PostgreSQL deployments in response to our load testing data. This ensures that your application has the resources it needs to perform well under high load, while also making efficient use of your cluster's resources.
