title: Setting up Scalable Storage with the EBS CSI Driver in Amazon EKS
sidebar_position: 7
---
## Objective
This guide shows you how to set up the EBS CSI Driver on your cluster, which enables dynamic provisioning of Amazon EBS volumes in Kubernetes. We'll leverage [IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html) configured during the creation of our cluster to provide the necessary permissions to the driver.

:::info

EBS CSI volumes only support the 'ReadWriteOnce' access mode. While this may seem restrictive, it's actually a good match for databases like PostgreSQL. PostgreSQL can handle multiple concurrent connections and queries, even though it runs on a single node. This means even if your application has numerous users reading from and writing to the database concurrently, PostgreSQL manages these operations internally. Therefore, using 'ReadWriteOnce' volumes with PostgreSQL on EKS is generally the recommended approach.

## Prerequisites
- [Setting up the AWS Application Load Balancer Controller (LBC) on the EKS Cluster](./setup-loadbalancing.md)

## 1. Verifying the Service Account
First, we need to make sure the "ebs-csi-controller-sa" service account is correctly set up in the "kube-system" namespace in our cluster.

Run the following command:

```bash
kubectl get sa ebs-csi-controller-sa -n kube-system -o yaml
```

Response:

```bash
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  annotations:
    eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: arn:aws:iam::999999999999:role/eksctl-fargate-quickstart-addon-iamserviceac-Role1-163G838NUHJH2
  creationTimestamp: "2023-09-11T16:21:50Z"
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: eksctl
  name: ebs-csi-controller-sa
  namespace: kube-system
  resourceVersion: "183181"
  uid: bcb09ee4-2e30-45ee-a1f7-50eea4c933ef
```

## 2. Adding the EBS CSI Driver as a Helm Repo
Start by adding the 'aws-ebs-csi-driver' as a helm repository. This makes the EBS CSI driver chart available to your helm client.

```bash
helm repo add aws-ebs-csi-driver https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/aws-ebs-csi-driver
```
You can search for the driver with the following command:
```bash
helm search repo aws-ebs-csi-driver
```

## 3. Updating the Helm Repo
Before installing the driver, make sure to update the helm repository:
```bash
helm repo update
```

## 4. Deploying the EBS CSI Driver
To install the EBS CSI driver on the EKS cluster in the current context, use the following Helm command:
```bash
helm upgrade --install aws-ebs-csi-driver \
  --namespace kube-system \
  --set serviceAccount.controller.create=false \
  --set serviceAccount.snapshot.create=false \
  --set enableVolumeScheduling=true \
  --set enableVolumeResizing=true \
  --set enableVolumeSnapshot=true \
  --set serviceAccount.snapshot.name=ebs-csi-controller-sa \
  --set serviceAccount.controller.name=ebs-csi-controller-sa \
  aws-ebs-csi-driver/aws-ebs-csi-driver
```

error seen
```
Error: rendered manifests contain a resource that already exists. Unable to continue with install: ServiceAccount "ebs-csi-controller-sa" in namespace "kube-system" exists and cannot be imported into the current release: invalid ownership metadata; label validation error: key "app.kubernetes.io/managed-by" must equal "Helm": current value is "eksctl"; annotation validation error: missing key "meta.helm.sh/release-name": must be set to "aws-ebs-csi-driver"; annotation validation error: missing key "meta.helm.sh/release-namespace": must be set to "kube-system"
```

Working script:
```bash
helm upgrade --install aws-ebs-csi-driver \
  --namespace kube-system \
  --set controller.serviceAccount.create=false \
  aws-ebs-csi-driver/aws-ebs-csi-driver
```

o/p seen :

```bash
Release "aws-ebs-csi-driver" does not exist. Installing it now.
NAME: aws-ebs-csi-driver
LAST DEPLOYED: Mon Sep 11 13:33:48 2023
NAMESPACE: kube-system
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
NOTES:
To verify that aws-ebs-csi-driver has started, run:

    kubectl get pod -n kube-system -l "app.kubernetes.io/name=aws-ebs-csi-driver,app.kubernetes.io/instance=aws-ebs-csi-driver"

NOTE: The [CSI Snapshotter](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/external-snapshotter) controller and CRDs will no longer be installed as part of this chart and moving forward will be a prerequisite of using the snap shotting functionality.
```

The output will confirm the successful installation of the EBS CSI driver:

```bash
Release "aws-ebs-csi-driver" has been upgraded. Happy Helming!
NAME: aws-ebs-csi-driver
