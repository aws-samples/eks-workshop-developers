## Objective

In this lab, you will learn a straightforward and efficient method for optimizing images from the [Open Container Initiative (OCI)](https://opencontainers.org/) using [Jib](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib).

## Prerequisites

- [Preparation](./baseline.md)

## Context

The OCI currently contains three specifications: the Runtime Specification, the Image Specification and the Distribution Specification. Jib is a tool to build optimized OCI images without using a container runtime. It's available as a Maven or Gradle-plugin as well as a Java library. In our case we're going to use the Maven-plugin in order to create an optimized container image.

The important part for the build with Jib can be found in the `pom.xml`-file in the plugins section:

```xml showLineNumbers
<plugin>
    <groupId>com.google.cloud.tools</groupId>
    <artifactId>jib-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>3.4.0</version>
    <configuration>
        <from><image>public.ecr.aws/docker/library/amazoncorretto:17.0.9-alpine3.18</image></from>
        <container>
            <user>1000</user>
        </container>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
```

At this stage, the configuration is quite compact. We simply specify that the Java process in the container image will not run as the root user, but instead with a different user ID. Additionally, we opt for the [Alpine Linux](https://www.alpinelinux.org/) base image to enhance the overall performance.

## 1. Changing the source code and pushing the image

You are now going to change the application code of `unicorn-store-spring/src/main/java/com/unicorn/store/controller/UnicornController.java ` to identify the new version of the application deployment.

Change the contents of the getWelcomeMessage function to identify the new version of the application:

```java showLineNumbers {3}
@GetMapping("/")
public ResponseEntity<String> getWelcomeMessage() {
    return new ResponseEntity<>("Welcome to the Unicorn Store - from Jib generated Image!", HttpStatus.OK);
}
```

Build new container images using `mvn compile jib:build`:

```bash showLineNumbers
export ECR_URI=$(aws ecr describe-repositories --repository-names unicorn-store-spring | jq --raw-output '.repositories[0].repositoryUri')
aws ecr get-login-password --region $AWS_REGION | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin $ECR_URI
cd ~/environment/unicorn-store-spring
IMAGE_TAG=i$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S)
IMAGE_PATH=$ECR_URI:$IMAGE_TAG
mvn compile jib:build -Dimage=$IMAGE_PATH

IMAGE_PATH=$ECR_URI:latest
mvn compile jib:build -Dimage=$IMAGE_PATH
```

## 2. Re-deploying the application

After pushing the new image to ECR, you can re-trigger the deployment of the application:

```bash showLineNumbers
kubectl rollout restart deploy unicorn-store-spring -n unicorn-store-spring
kubectl rollout status deployment unicorn-store-spring -n unicorn-store-spring
```

## 3. Testing the application

Run the following API call to verify that the new version of the application was successfully deployed:

```bash showLineNumbers
export SVC_URL=http://$(kubectl get svc unicorn-store-spring -n unicorn-store-spring -o json | jq --raw-output '.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname')
curl --location --request GET $SVC_URL'/' --header 'Content-Type: application/json'; echo
```

## 4. Retrieving the results

1. Verify the new application image size in the [Amazon ECR](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/home#/) console:

![jib-ecr](./images/jib-ecr.png)

2. Retrieve the logs for the application as outlined in the previous section. Below you can find an example starting time after the optimization of the Amazon EKS deployment:

```bash showLineNumbers
kubectl logs $(kubectl get pods -n unicorn-store-spring -o json | jq --raw-output '.items[0].metadata.name') -n unicorn-store-spring
kubectl logs $(kubectl get pods -n unicorn-store-spring -o json | jq --raw-output '.items[0].metadata.name') -n unicorn-store-spring | grep "Started StoreApplication"
```

## Conclusion

As you can see, we managed to decrease the container image size from 380 MB to 212 MB, resulting in a reduction of approximately 45% without making any changes to the code. This was achieved by using Jib and the Linux Alpine base image for container creation. Additionally, the application startup time improved by around 2 seconds.
